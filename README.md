# MVVM_showcase_QuoteRecorder
An practice app for me to learn the MVVM code structure! This app is made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7UxPYxgBoA&ab_channel=ResoCoder)
MVVM is really a clean structure, I love it. With the help of LiveData and ViewModel, MVVM enables me to organize my code better. It is for sure my Go To for now.

## WMMA supports:
- Adding quotes and author to a list

## Some new things Iâ€™ve learned:
- MVVM
- Using LiveData and ViewModel
- Dependency Injection
- What Data Transfer Object is

## Libraries and resources I used 
- Android architecture components
